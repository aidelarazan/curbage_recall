Aging impacts episodic memories, including the way they are organized. Younger adults often organize items based on temporal context, whereas older adults show greater reliance on semantic relationships. Given that these findings are largely derived from studies using word-lists, an important question remains: Do these phenomena extend to complex, real-world memories that consists of meaningfully connected events? Here, we conducted an experiment using a naturalistic stimulus that allows one to organize recall along different principles: Temporal associations, semantic relationships, topics, and causally connected storylines. Older (N=36) and younger (N=46) participants viewed and recalled an episode of a “slice-of-life” television sitcom. We applied list-learning analysis techniques (e.g., lag-conditional response probabilities, temporal clustering, and topic clustering scores) to examine age differences in recall organization. Our results revealed that younger adults showed greater reliance on temporal structure, whereas older adults exhibited increased topic-based clustering. Older adults also showed diminished forward asymmetry even within shared topics, suggesting a broader shift away from fine-grained temporal structure. Despite these organizational differences, overall recall performance did not differ between groups; however, temporal organization was associated with better recall performance across age groups. Additionally, we found that events with more causal connections were recalled more than events with fewer causal connections across age groups, demonstrating the critical role of narrative structure in supporting memory retrieval. Together, our results demonstrate that aging shifts the principles underlying memory organization, and highlight the utility of naturalistic paradigms in revealing subtle changes in memory processes across the lifespan.

### Experimental Design
Encoding: Participants watched an episode of a television sitcom (Curb Your Enthusiasm S01E07 AAMCO). Critcally, four central storylines were identified: Caterer, Chevy, Dinner Party, and Other, all of which storylines of different topics were interleaved with one another throughout the episode. Events based on meaningful transitions between topics: Caterer, Chevy, Dinner Party, and Other, resulting in 37 total events (10 Caterer, 10 Chevy, 12 Dinner Party, and 5 Other).

Retrieval: After encoding, participants completed a free recall task. In the free recall task, participants were presented with a fixation point in the center of a computer screen, and were instructed to verbally recall everything that they can remember about the episode. While participants were told that they could recall the events in any order, it was advised that it may be easier to recall it in the order of how it was encoded. Participants were encouraged to continue recalling as long as they remember additional details.
