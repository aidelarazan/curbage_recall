101,older,exp2,and then Jeff says I need to talk to you about something very important and then walks from behind his desk to sit on the couch next to Larry where Larry is lounging. and then Jeff says that he was upset or hurt because Larry didn't congratulate him on his new car and Larry was again taken aback because he didn't think it was that big a deal that he had to I guess I'd congratulate Jeff on the new car. and Jeff told those very important to him. so Larry apologized said he was sorry for not congratulating them on the new car. then Jeff says let's go for a ride and Larry said what? now? and Jeff said yeah right now let's go. and so Larry says yeah let's go.,C2,6,,C,Jeff's Office,Chevy,Jeff moves to the couch and tells Larry that he is disappointed that Larry did not congratulate him on his new car.

101,older,exp2,so they go outside to the car. it's a nice pretty blue 57 Chevy Bel-Air I guess with the top down convertible. and he Jeff I guess offers Larry to drive the car. So Larry is driving the car ,D1,7,,D,Driving Chevy on the Street,Chevy,Jeff and Larry take the car for a drive and Jeff is impressed with the car and understands why Jeff was upset.,40
101,older,exp2,"and going down the street and Larry stops at a stop sign a um yeah stop sign. and they're talking they have the radio on. and it commercial come on for Aamco. And as the famous slogan says double-A MCO. after the double-A goes beep beep. Larry hears the beep beep thinks it's the car behind them beeping him for stopping at the stop sign or not moving fast enough forward. So Larry turns around and starts yelling cursing at the guy behind him the guy behind him curses back. 
Jeff is in the meantime say well it was the commercial going to beep beep it was on the radio, it was a commercial. 
and Larry wasn't hearing that and then the guy behind them Rams into the back of Jeff new car, bumps him, maybe once or twice and then pulls back and then speeds off, pulls around behind or around the side of them and speeds. And [driver] is cursing at the Jeff and Larry. and then Larry and Jeff start driving forward. and the car is making this terrible noise like something's wrong with it. and always fussing there before 
so they stopped to get out. Jeff is kind of yelling at Larry It was a commercial that was the beep beep it wasn't a real horn behind them. and so I get out looking back of the car, and Jeff is kind of upset because evidentally there's some damage. 
So then Jeff gets in the car, the driver seat. and they drive off.",D3,8,,D,Driving Chevy on the Street,Chevy,Larry tells Jeff to turn the radio on. Larry wants to head back but Jeff insists they continue.  An AAMCO commercial comes on the radio with two beeps.

Jeff gets back in his car and Larry explains the he thought the car honked at him. Jeff asks if he's ever heard of the AAMCO commercial before.,257
101,older,exp2,"and then I guess the next scene is they’re at home Larry's at his house with his wife Cheryl. and he walks in the house. Cheryl is there with her friend. and I can't forget her name. and they the friend it brought back a evidently movie that Larry made 
and then Larry comes in as he usually does and kind of asked her what would you think of it.  she said she enjoyed it.  and Larry's going to be obnoxious. he's eating some nuts or something. it says so he's really kind of testing her of whether or not she really enjoyed it or not. and he asked her what she enjoyed about it and I think the lady said something about the Expressions on people's faces. and Larry starts making Expressions you know like a grimace or a shocked face. and then Cheryl’s friend says she has to leave. ",B1,9,4.0,B,The David's Back Patio,Other,Larry walks through his kitchen and into the patio area and sees his wife Cheryl with her friend Julie.

101,older,exp2,and then I forgot the name of the movie. and anyway after the Friendly's Larry tell Cheryl that she doesn't want her give that movie to any of your friends anymore cuz he doesn't want them I guess he doesn't want to hear their opinions about it. ,other,11,,B,The David's Back Patio,Other,Larry tells Cheryl not to loan the movie out.,48
101,older,exp2,"Anyway, it seemed kind of ends maybe at some point they're talking about the dinner party they're going to have on Friday night. oh yeah well the friend is still there ",B2,12,5.0,B,The David's Back Patio,Dinner_Party,Julie gets up to leave and mentions the dinner party on Friday night,32
101,older,exp2,Cheryl says that the caterer backed out of the dinner party because personal reasons. and Larry's like well people don't know when people. his personal reasons they don’t you to ask about why they don't want to do whatever they said they're not going to do. and so Leary offers that his friend Jeff's neighbor is a caterer. and Jeff is always saying I know she's good caterer so Larry tell Cheryl that he can call or she can call Jeff and get the name of the caterer. and that would solve their problem for the Friday night dinner party.,B3,13,6.0,B,The David's Back Patio,Caterer,Cheryl mentions that their caterer cancelled Larry asks why the caterer cancelled and Cheryl says it is due to personal reasons Larry suggests that Cheryl calls's Jeff's neighbor to cater the dinner,100
101,older,exp2,"then I guess it's some point maybe in the next thing is they’re at the dinner party. and this is at Larry and Cheryl's house. and Larry is making small talk with some man and his wife about evidently this guy move in this office from Downey to Covina. and you can tell Larry he's just kind of bored by it but trying to be polite I guess by listening. and um, then they move on and kind of over over shoulder Larry sees this guy who ends up being Mike Duffy. And mike thanks him for having a dinner party, inviting him over. He said you got great artwork. Larry says, yeah thanks. ",E1,14,,E,Dinner Party,Dinner_Party,"At the dinner party, Larry talks to a couple who are moving from Covina to Downy. Larry tells his wife.

They begin talking about Seinfield and Mike asks Larry if Larry gets paid for the re-runs that is still aired. ",115
101,older,exp2,and the guy somehow mentions that he's an Aamco dealer or owner of an Aamco store. and Larry thinks he's kind of making a joke about Larry's run-in with the guy at the stop sign and the Aamco radio cuz I guess he had told Cheryl and Larry thinks assumes the guys kind of give him a hard time or making a joke making fun of it. but he really isn't. and anyway they get talking about Larry's incident with the car and the guy offers that he can fix the car. He’s kind of a specialty in that area and something they get off to a good relationship there. Larry’s really appreciative. the guy Mike Duffy gives him his business card and tells me to call him and set up something to fix the car. ,E2,15,,E,Dinner Party,Chevy,Mike makes a comment about how it will be good if he got paid for all the AAMCO transmissions and Larry thinks Cheryl told Mike about the incident. Mike says he owns 3 AAMCO stations. Larry tells Mike that Jeff got a 57 Chevy and then talks about the car accident he got into with Jeff earlier.  Mike tells Larry that he can take a look at the damaged car.,137
101,older,exp2,anyway then Cheryl says it's dinner time ,E3,16,,E,Dinner Party,Dinner_Party,The caterer comes in and tells Cheryl that dinner is ready and Cheryl announces to everyone that it is dinner time. ,8
101,older,exp2,"and everyone walks to the dinner/dining room. and they're all like all this is so nice it looks very nicely set table and very professional. and Cheryl says wait a minute, everybody just sit wherever you like. and so is her about to sit down the Mike, Aamco guy, Mike Duffy takes head of the table which is Larry’s seat, clearly. And Cheryl sits at the other end of the table which they would do as a couple, you know opposite ends. and Larry ends up having to sit next to Mike. 
Mike is kind of taking charge like he's giving the party at that point, telling everybody is great for them to be there. and then they'll dig in but before that Larry's er, Mike's as always I feel more other tradition and he says grace before dinner. And he’s clearly is Catholic and makes a sign of cross. and Larry sitting next to on the Larry's definitely Jewish and doesn't participate but doesn't really make any big face or anybody could tell Larry's kind of peeved. And so then after the grace is finished after you know the grace has [been] said Larry says is it okay to, sarcastic says, is it okay to start the salad. And mike says yeah yeah yeah everybody and so hilariously [Larry is] like is it okay really is it okay. so he's being sarcastic about starting the dinner salad. and they finish and that’s kind of the end of the scene there. and then after the dinner-party Larry is.",E6,17,,E,Dinner Party,Dinner_Party,The guests enter the dining room and Cheryl directs them to take a seat anywhere they would like. ,258
101,older,exp2,"Oh, previously, the joke between Larry and Cheryl is that Cherly had said that Larry. she asked him to have a good time at the party and Larry's like you know I'm not really up for that. she snice I know I'm not going to have a good time and she says well you’ve already decided that you’re not going to have a good time. So then Larry says no I will try I'll try to have a good time. and Cheryl says alright I want you to have a good time. and Larry says well let's make a bet that if I have a good time and Larry says if I win the bet you have to give me a b****** in the car and Cheryl agrees.  ",B7,18,,B,The David's Back Patio,Dinner_Party,Larry makes a bet with Cheryl saying that he will not like the dinner party. The bet is a blowjob in the car. ,128
101,older,exp2,"so then later after the dinner party, they’re in the bedroom. and Larry I guess you're talking about having a good time. Larry said he had a good time told Cheryl he had a good time. and I guess you believed him. and he said well somebody lost the bet so he's going to hold that overhead. And then I guess that's kind of the end of the bedroom scene.  ",F3,19,,F,The Davids' Bedroom,Dinner_Party,Larry talks more about the dinner party and mentions that they said grace. Cheryl asks Larry if he had a good time at the dinner party. Larry says no and reminds Cheryl that she lost a bet.,70
101,older,exp2,"Then the next morning they're in the kitchen Cheryl's in there already reading the paper. Larry comes in a cup of coffee. and I guess they kind of commiserate it that they had a good party. and Larry says I’m going to get one of those apple turnovers. and goes the refrigerator. He is looking and he doesn't see one. he asked her where the turnover. she says they're in the refrigerator. he's looking looking. he doesn't see them. she says yeah I know how you look so she comes over and looks and she looks in the refrigerator. and they can't find any food, they don't see any food leftovers. and Larry's like well what happened to the food. did they who took the food. and goes the refrigerator. He is looking and he doesn't see one. he asked her where the turnover. she says they're in the refrigerator. he's looking looking. he doesn't see them. she says yeah I know how you look so she comes over and looks and she looks in the refrigerator. and they can't find any food, they don't see any food leftovers. and Larry's like well what happened to the food. did they who took the food.  and then they kind of assumed that it was the caterer that just took the food. and I think it's some point Cheryl might remember that she did see the caterer walking out the door with the tray or one of those too. but they didn't really make a big deal about it. and then so they both come to the conclusion that the caterer just left with the leftovers. And they’re upset because well he pay for the food and it's their food. they didn't tell the caterer she could have leftovers.  so then Cheryl calls up the caterer and tells her that they want the food back  and if they don't get the food back they're going to cancel the check for the catering service. and then evidently the caterer says okay fine you can have the food. and Cheryl says well I’m going to Larry over in a little while to get the food.  ",G3,20,,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Caterer,Larry wants an apple turnover and walks over to the refrigerator but can't find it. ,364
101,older,exp2,"Larry goes over there later evidently. and has kind of confrontation with the caterer who told you you can take the food. She doesn't really answer he says where's the chicken. she says well there really wasn't any chicken left so to speak. and he's kind of pushing her about that. So then she goes in the refrigerator pulls out of a tray which evidently has fair amount of chicken in it. and put them on top of the other tray that she'd pulled out. so now Larry's got the food he brings it home, leaves evidently.  ",H1,21,,H,Caterer's House,Caterer,Larry is at the caterer's house and asks for the food. The caterer tells him that she gave the food to the homeless shelter. Another woman comes by and tells the caterer that she dropped the food off to Jeff's. Larry and the caterer continue to argue and the caterer is in denial.,97
101,older,exp2,and then the next scene you see him walking down the street with double trays in his hands with the food. ,K1,22,,K,Walking on the Street,Caterer,Larry is walking down the street with platters of food and a homeless man asks if he has any spare change. Larry asks the homeless man if he goes to the shelter and what food they serve there. The homeless man tells Larry that they usually serve soup and peanut butter. Larry asks if the homeless man wants the food and the homeless man takes it.,22
101,older,exp2,"and then earlier while they were in the kitchen Larry and Cheryl. Uh, Larry checks the phone messages and there's a voicemail from Mike Duffy the Ammco Guy saying something important he wants to talk to Larry about, he'll be in the office at 12:30. Um, give him a call.  ",G1,23,,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Dinner_Party,Larry enters the kitchen and notices that there is a message on the answering machine. The message is from Mike and tells Larry that he feels weird about something from the dinner party. ,50
101,older,exp2,and so I guess then I'm jumping up scene or two up. Jeff and Larry with the Ammco dealer the car shop on the rack. And Mike Duffy's looking at the car comes over and tells him that he's got good news and bad news. the bad news is there's damage but the good news is that he's kind of an expert in this field and transmission for these type older cars and they they can fix it. and so then they have a little back-and-forth that Mike says a you pay for the parts and I'll give you the labor. Larrys like no let me pay for the labor. so I guess somehow they come to some agreement.,J1,24,,J,AAMCO Station,Chevy,Larry and Jeff are at the AAMCO station. Mike tells them that there is an issue with the transmission and that he can fix it. ,119
101,older,exp2,and Mike says he needs to talk to Larry in his office. So they go to Mike's office. and Mike says something he's got something important to tell Larry. ,J2,25,,J,AAMCO Station,Dinner_Party,Mike asks Larry if he can speak to him in private.,30
101,older,exp2,"and Larry jumps in and says you know you know somehow you got word that I’m not real comfortable people saying her guest house at Martha's Vineyard. and [Mike says] no no I go to Martha's Vineyard all the time we're not going to impose upon you to stay in your guest house. And Larry says, “no, you can probably do that.” and the guy is kind of offended cuz he thinks that Larry doesn't want him to stay there. but now he's kind of weaseling out of it. anyway the guy ends up getting offended and says what I really would call you in here for was I do apologize I apologize for sitting in your seat at the dinner table.  Which Larry jump to conclusions before the guy even had chance to say what he was calling him in there for.  anyway the guy gets kind of huffy and kicks Larry out of the office says he's got take a phone call. So Larry leaves.  ",J4,26,,J,AAMCO Station,Dinner_Party,"Mike tells Larry to take a seat in his office and thanks him about the dinner party. Mike begins to apologize to Larry but Larry cuts him off and tells him that Cheryl should have not said anything about the vineyard. Mike was apologizing for taking the head of the table. Larry and Mike argue, talking past each other. Mike ends the conversation.",169
101,older,exp2,"and then this is probably towards the end, yeah I guess maybe the next scene or the final scene is Larry and Cheryl in a car it's dark. and evidentially they just going out to eat. and they said they both had a great dinner. and Larry's stops and looks at Cheryl and says I guess somebody owes me somebody lost the bet. and he's reminding her of the earlier bet about whether or not he would have good time at the dinner party. and then that's the end of the show. ",other,27,,L,The Davids' Car,Dinner_Party,Cheryl and Larry are driving from dinner and Larry reminds Cheryl about the bet.,92

319,younger,exp1, and then they go into conversation about the dinner party and the main character says he won't enjoy but he'll try to enjoy it and they offer a bet a little bit inappropriate but for the situation was pretty funny sexual exploit for to see if they would enjoy the dinner party regarding for the protagonist ,B7,16,10.0,B,The David's Back Patio,Dinner_Party,Larry questions why she wants to have a dinner party. Cheryl says parties are fun. Larry makes a bet with Cheryl saying that he will not like the dinner party. The bet is a blowjob in the car. ,58
319,younger,exp1,and I believe they do contact Jeff to get the phone number of the caterer but we don't really see a direct contact with the caterer other than that nothing really happens for that situation ,B5,17,8.0,B,The David's Back Patio,Caterer,Larry picks up the phone and leaves Jeff a message asking for the caterer's phone number,36

319,younger,exp1,but that's it conversation was kind of small talk you would have like a party like conversations really don't want to know for a couple one I believe which will be the original friend that lent the movie their conversation was based on the moving from I don't know what city but it was based on what they're moving second conversation with the second couple was based on the cruise and what they saw on the ship on the performance and some character named Alice in the guns something like that and their conversation will be with the third couple about their job Small Talk initially and then we going to the one of the plot devices is that the third couple the husband ,E1,20,16.0,E,Dinner Party,Dinner_Party,"At the dinner party, Larry talks to a couple who are moving from Covina to Downy.

Mike tells Larry that he can take a look at the damaged car.,65
319,younger,exp1,we then  transition to a scene where that dinner the Aamco employee sits at the main head of the table while the protagonist stares in disbelief and doesn't want to say anything dinner precedes or some awkward tensions  between a difference in  I wanna say culture or something like that they start with initial prayer which the protagonist and his wife were not really comfortable with and the AAMCO employee seems to  overstep his boundaries which would make the protagonist uncomfortable but again nothing was really verbally spoken all situational and in context dinner preceded ,E6,22,21.0,E,Dinner Party,Dinner_Party,"The guests enter the dining room and Cheryl directs them to take a seat anywhere they would like. Mike takes the head of the table and Larry is surprised. Mike asks like he is the host with a prayer, speech, and cheers.

Larry mentions that Mike took the head of table.,23
319,younger,exp1, and the religious difference of the prayer and how that kind of made them uneasy but they went with it for they didn't give a reason really why they went with it but they just went with it and kind of made some jokes about it some humor ,F3,27,24.0,F,The Davids' Bedroom,Dinner_Party,Larry talks more about the dinner party and mentions that they said grace. Cheryl asks Larry if he had a good time at the dinner party. Larry says no and reminds Cheryl that she lost a bet.,50
319,younger,exp1,and then we were presented with the next morning wherewe see that the husband and wife are in their kitchen slash living room,G1,28,25.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Other,Larry enters the kitchen and Cheryl is at the table. Larry mentions he wants to get a new toothpaste. ,23
319,younger,exp1,and they're talking about the events of the main focus on that one was one the leftover food is gone to which they called the suspected that the caterer threw away the food they contacted her via phone and they did confirm that the caterer took the food with her after the party which was one of the main plot devices on how inappropriate that was,G3,29,27.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Caterer,Larry wants an apple turnover and walks over to the refrigerator but can't find it. Cheryl looks for the leftovers after. The leftovers seem to be missing. Cheryl and Larry are wondering if the caterer took the leftovers. Larry vaguely remembers seeing the caterer walk out with a platter. Cheryl calls the caterer and the caterer admits that she took the leftovers home. Cheryl tells her that she will cancel the check if she does not get the leftovers back. Cheryl tells her that Larry will pick up the leftovers.,66
319,younger,exp1,another topic of the situation bring I seen  was that the husband was informed by the wife that there was some gossip or misunderstanding between the wife communicating with some of the Friends word regarding a Vineyard Guesthouse they have and not wanting people to stay in also beforehand I forgot to mention that the AAMCO employee left a vague message to the main character I believe it like at 7:50 a.m. about being uncomfortable about some event in the party but doesn't really specify to which the main character judges as like unnecessary stating like why not just say what you're upset about or just say call me back instead of leaving this vague message that will bring doubt and like thought throughout the day so that happened,G2,30,26.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Dinner_Party,Larry notices that there is a message on the answering machine. The message is from Mike and tells Larry that he feels weird about something from the dinner party. Larry and Cheryl speculate what the message is about and Larry thinks it might be about Mike taking the head of table. Cheryl tells Larry it might be about how Larry does not like it when people stay at their guesthouse in Martha's Vineyard. Maggie might have overheard and might have told Mike because Maggie and Mike were planning on going to vacation there. ,130
319,younger,exp1,that was mainly what happened in that scene other small details but the main gist is that they call the caterer regarding the food,G3,31,27.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Caterer,Larry wants an apple turnover and walks over to the refrigerator but can't find it. Cheryl looks for the leftovers after. The leftovers seem to be missing. Cheryl and Larry are wondering if the caterer took the leftovers.

Cheryl tells her that she will cancel the check if she does not get the leftovers back. Cheryl tells her that Larry will pick up the leftovers.,24
319,younger,exp1, and Aamco employee leaving the vague message and then the miscommunication about the vineyard,G2,32,26.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Dinner_Party,Larry notices that there is a message on the answering machine. The message is from Mike and tells Larry that he feels weird about something from the dinner party. Larry and Cheryl speculate what the message is about and Larry thinks it might be about Mike taking the head of table. Cheryl tells Larry it might be about how Larry does not like it when people stay at their guesthouse in Martha's Vineyard. Maggie might have overheard and might have told Mike because Maggie and Mike were planning on going to vacation there. ,15
319,younger,exp1,so then the next scene we’re seeing the main character picking up the food from the caterer and they get into a little dispute arguing back and forth on what happened to the food the caterer make assumption or a lie that she donated the food to a homeless shelter however it soon revealed that via a secondary employee of the caterer that she dropped off food to Jeff which was David's friends so after that whole confrontation and argumentation between the caterer and the main character,H1,33,28.0,H,Caterer's House,Caterer,Larry is at the caterer's house and asks for the food. The caterer tells him that she gave the food to the homeless shelter. Another woman comes by and tells the caterer that she dropped the food off to Jeff's. Larry and the caterer continue to argue and the caterer is in denial.,87
319,younger,exp1,main character transitions to his friends Jeff’s house and we see him eating leftover food if I remember correctly Apple bites or some apple pastry was the main concern of the main character so that was kind of like not like main focus but kind of a big detail about that scene but yeah so we transition into Jeff's kitchen which is David's friend and we see them eating and they talk and then the main character kind of confronts Jeff about stealing his food not really that harmful it's more like a humorous but with some slight like agitation but overall humorous ,I1,34,29.0,I,Jeff's Kitchen,Caterer,Jeff is eating the leftover chicken when Larry visits. Jeff tells Larry that he was going to drop them off to his house. Larry sits down and eats the apple turnovers. ,104
319,younger,exp1,then we transition to the fact that the main character states to his friend that the AAMCO employee is willing to fix the Chevys that got injured secondary to the Aamco commercial so they discuss that blablabla and then they transition to the scene of him visiting the AAMCO station ,J1,35,31.0,J,AAMCO Station,Chevy,Larry and Jeff are at the AAMCO station. Mike tells them that there is an issue with the transmission and that he can fix it. ,51
319,younger,exp1,I also forgotten that beforehand they do re-tell the the main character re-tells to his friend Jeff that AAMCO employee was brought up some event,I2,36,30.0,I,Jeff's Kitchen,Chevy,Jeff brings up a message that Larry left him and Larry says there might be a problem. Larry begins explaining the situation about Martha's Vineyard. ,25
319,younger,exp1,so after that they transition to the actual AAMCO store and a brief small Talk between the characters the main character and the best friend or whatever friend Jeff the main kind of conversation,J1,37,31.0,J,AAMCO Station,Chevy,Larry and Jeff are at the AAMCO station.

319,younger,exp1,they have is that Jeff wants the main character to just be nice apologize to anything to the AAMCO employee to make sure that his car gets fixed,J3,38,33.0,J,AAMCO Station,Chevy, And Jeff tells Larry to apologize if he has to. ,28
319,younger,exp1,after that we transition to the main character and the AAMCO employe talking in a small enclosed space about an uncomfortable event that AAMCO employee initially brought up and one of the humor plot devices it was trying to use was that there was a misunderstanding between the two or the main character initially thought the uncomfortable event was the fact that he doesn't want people to be within his guest house in the vineyard and the AAMCO employee was going up to the vineyard so this suggests that he didn't want the employee to stay in his guest house but for the AAMCO employees the uncomfortable event he was suggesting was him sitting head of the table and kind of bossing around the dinner while it was at the main characters house and not his house anyways situation roses and from  the main character suggesting that he didn't want or not suggesting but apologizing for suggesting apologizing for his wife suggesting that they didn't want him at the vineyard leads the AAMCO employee to get frustrated from the whole event which I really don't understand I can't lie but argumentation sooner follows and both parties are going back and forth about apologizing misunderstanding and eventually leads to the AAMCO employee indirectly kicking out the the main character ,J4,39,34.0,J,AAMCO Station,Dinner_Party,"Mike tells Larry to take a seat in his office and thanks him about the dinner party. Mike begins to apologize to Larry but Larry cuts him off and tells him that Cheryl should have not said anything about the vineyard. Mike was apologizing for taking the head of the table. Larry and Mike argue, talking past each other. Mike ends the conversation.",220
319,younger,exp1, and then we transition to a scene of the main character and jeff which was the main character's friends driving in the Chevy I'm not exactly sure if the car was fixed it still had a slight noise but mostly assume the car was fixed ,J5,40,35.0,J,AAMCO Station,Chevy,Jeff and Larry are driving in the 57 Chevy in silence and there is a rumbling sound from the car. ,47
319,younger,exp1,then from that we go back to the homeless guy that was initially met in the beginning and we see that the main character is holding his leftover food that he got from the caterer and ask the homeless homeless character if the homeless shelter that the caterer said they donate the food serves any of donating food which the homeless character States no they only serve like soup and bread basic necessities which again was another humor device we realize like again the caterer was lying and the main character offers to give his leftovers to the homeless man do what your homeless man again ask what is it going back to that humour device of picking and choosing what  you don't have like that since you are you don't really have that begging and choosing something whatever that saying is so to give him the food ,K1,41,36.0,K,Walking on the Street,Caterer,Larry is walking down the street with platters of food and a homeless man asks if he has any spare change.

416,older,exp1,and he and his wife go back upstairs or in the bedroom Larry and his wife Cheryl and he's saying GI I can't believe that he sat in my chair,F1,29,22.0,F,The Davids' Bedroom,Dinner_Party,Larry and Cheryl is in the bedroom talking about the dinner party.

416,older,exp1,and she said so you didn't have a good time at party and he says no I did not have a good time at the party so evidently and again I forget the original terms of the bet but so Larry wins the bet any kind of wait which means are going to probably have a a sexy night together,F3,32,24.0,F,The Davids' Bedroom,Dinner_Party,Larry talks more about the dinner party and mentions that they said grace. Cheryl asks Larry if he had a good time at the dinner party. Larry says no and reminds Cheryl that she lost a bet.,60
416,older,exp1,so the next scene I believe is then when they go to their the AAMCO transmission place and Larry's there with his friend Jeff and the car and the guy has it up on the rack,J1,33,31.0,J,AAMCO Station,Chevy,Larry and Jeff are at the AAMCO station. Mike tells them that there is an issue with the transmission and that he can fix it. ,36
416,older,exp1,and and he said oh no no wait no that's not the next scene I think no forget that the I think the next scene is the next morning that's it they get up for breakfast,G1,34,25.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Other,Larry enters the kitchen and Cheryl is at the table. Larry mentions he wants to get a new toothpaste. ,36
416,older,exp1,and Larry's like I think I'm going to have some leftover apple turnovers and she and he says where are they the catering was good and I'm going to have she says well they're in the fridge so he opens  Larry David opens the fridge he says there's no apple turnovers in here and his wife says you know I'm sure they're in the refrigerator and he's looking they check it out and there's there's nothing in fact there's no leftovers in the refrigerator from the night before so Larry and Cheryl say oh my God this is I wonder what happened to The Leftovers did somebody take them did somebody take them home and then Cheryl says you know what I I can’t remember if it’s Cheryl or Larry but they said must be I didn't see anybody taking anything except I do recall the caterer I think his wife Cheryl says to the caterer or no Larry says he she had some kind of tray of food tray that she was carrying out of the house and so they said gee do you think that was the leftover food well it must have been so Cheryl says Larry you go over and talk to the caterer because that's like stealing for her to take that food home and not leave it with them because they already paid for the food she shouldn't have taken it and that's like stealing si Larry says okay so you want me to go,G3,35,27.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Caterer,Larry wants an apple turnover and walks over to the refrigerator but can't find it. Cheryl looks for the leftovers after. The leftovers seem to be missing. Cheryl and Larry are wondering if the caterer took the leftovers. Larry vaguely remembers seeing the caterer walk out with a platter. Cheryl calls the caterer and the caterer admits that she took the leftovers home. Cheryl tells her that she will cancel the check if she does not get the leftovers back. Cheryl tells her that Larry will pick up the leftovers.,252
416,older,exp1, so Larry goes over to the Caterers house so he's over there that you can next scene he's at the Caterers house and the caterers says Larry comes and you can tell they're at odds now they're they're not liking each other so Larry says I need to know what did you do with the food and she says that she left it at the 4th Street something-or-other the homeless shelter that she dropped the food off to a homeless shelter and Larry says oh well then where which one was it and she says the 4th street or whatever so I left it a homeless shelter he asks which one fourth street and he was like oh alright and then and then he says well you know what about the chicken what happened to the chicken you know what happened and she says over there wellI don't think there was any chicken left she's like pretending there was really no food left  when there really was and you know he's wondering what happened to the food so I forget how you know I don't know if she said that she might have given a little something over to Jeff the neighbor I can't remember if she said that or not,H1,36,28.0,H,Caterer's House,Caterer,Larry is at the caterer's house and asks for the food. The caterer tells him that she gave the food to the homeless shelter. Another woman comes by and tells the caterer that she dropped the food off to Jeff's. Larry and the caterer continue to argue and the caterer is in denial.,213
416,older,exp1,but the next scene he's over at Jeff the neighbor's house and all,I1,37,29.0,I,Jeff's Kitchen,Caterer,Jeff is eating the leftover chicken when Larry visits. Jeff tells Larry that he was going to drop them off to his house. Larry sits down and eats the apple turnovers. ,13
416,older,exp1,I got to go back for the two and just say that that when they first call the caterer to say that Larry was coming over Cheryl was kind of mean she said if if we don't find out what happened to that food we're going to cancel the check so which I was surprised but anyway so the next thing I think after the Caterers houses,G3,38,27.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Caterer,Larry wants an apple turnover and walks over to the refrigerator but can't find it. Cheryl looks for the leftovers after. The leftovers seem to be missing. Cheryl and Larry are wondering if the caterer took the leftovers. Larry vaguely remembers seeing the caterer walk out with a platter. Cheryl calls the caterer and the caterer admits that she took the leftovers home. Cheryl tells her that she will cancel the check if she does not get the leftovers back. Cheryl tells her that Larry will pick up the leftovers.,67
416,older,exp1,he goes next door over to Jeff's house and there is Jeff eating a bunch of the chicken so clearly Jeff ended up somehow getting some of the chicken and so  now he knows that he doesn't know how Jeff happening whether Jeff ask for it or the caterer just gave it to him or maybe she makes a regular thing out of that who knows but Jeff got a bunch of the leftovers so his friend Jeff ends up getting ,I1,39,29.0,I,Jeff's Kitchen,Caterer,Jeff is eating the leftover chicken when Larry visits. Jeff tells Larry that he was going to drop them off to his house. Larry sits down and eats the apple turnovers. ,83
416,older,exp1,so then the but so it must be that Larry was able to get some of these leftovers in trays because they're going down the street again and the homeless guy is there again in the meantime I think Larry asked Jeff if he's heard of this particular homeless shelter anyway so he asks the guy who's on the street does he know of this shelter and he goes yeah I go there I've eaten there you know I've had food there and he says do they ever serve chicken l’orange or you know whatever this fancy kind of meal is and the guy says no we've never had that and then Larry hands him the trays and he says here would you like this and the guy says what is it is it's chicken a l'orange and it's whatever and it really beautiful food the guy says sure and he takes it so I think I don't know if that's the end ,K1,40,36.0,K,Walking on the Street,Caterer,Larry is walking down the street with platters of food and a homeless man asks if he has any spare change. Larry asks the homeless man if he goes to the shelter and what food they serve there. The homeless man tells Larry that they usually serve soup and peanut butter. Larry asks if the homeless man wants the food and the homeless man takes it.,164
416,older,exp1,anyway the next there's the scene I know there's the scene of going to the Aamco place to get the car fixed and and Larry and his friend Jeff are there and I'm not sure exactly which order this scene was in but the scene at the where they get the Aamco car fixed and the mike guy is fixing the car and then gets to a discussion about who's going to pay for this repair and the Mike guy is very nice he says so I'm going to he says don't worry about it he says I'm covering the labor if you just pay for the parts the owner of the Aamco Place Mike says I'll cover the labor don't worry about it so Larry is about to go in and sit down with Mike and find out you know what has to be done the cost the parts and everything and then his friend Jeff says hey you know don't blow this let whatever he wants be nice to him cuz he want you know he wants to get his car fixed ,J1,41,31.0,J,AAMCO Station,Chevy,Larry and Jeff are at the AAMCO station. Mike tells them that there is an issue with the transmission and that he can fix it. ,185
416,older,exp1, so Larry goes in and he's sitting with Mike the the guy and oh well I'll go back to this and said he sits with Mike and Larry manages to piss Mike off during the discussion,J4,42,34.0,J,AAMCO Station,Dinner_Party,"Mike tells Larry to take a seat in his office and thanks him about the dinner party. Mike begins to apologize to Larry but Larry cuts him off and tells him that Cheryl should have not said anything about the vineyard. Mike was apologizing for taking the head of the table. Larry and Mike argue, talking past each other. Mike ends the conversation.",37
416,older,exp1,I mean because what happened was I'm just thinking before Larry left to go to the car place and meet his friend Jeff at the Aamco place he gets this phone call so I got to skip back a little bit he they get a phone call a message  a Phone message and it's from that guy Mike who owns the Aamco place and Mike says he says hey you know something is bothering me a little bit about last night and I need to talk to you but you know it's 7:30 in the morning I'll talk to you later in the day when I see you when you come over to the place so there's another bet that goes on between Larry and his wife Cheryl and Cheryl bet she thinks it has to do with some remarks that she made to Mike's wife Maggie I think was her name about that they know they don't let people stay in their guest house and so that probably he's pissed off about that or Maggie told said something to him because they were going to Martha’s Vineyard and their guest houses on Martha's Vineyard and he said he's going to be mad that you know he's going to he's probably upset that we didn't offer or say it was okay for them to stay in their guest house he said but it's okay we don't want them staying in the guest house so that's what she thinks Mike wants to talk to him about when he sees them later on at the Aamco place but Larry thinks know what he's probably going to talk to him that's a bet he's going to apologize for sitting in his chair so that he sat in the armchair at the head of the table and that he took Larry's chair the host’s chair he shouldn't have done that so they have this bet ,G2,43,26.0,G,The Davids' Kitchen,Dinner_Party,Larry notices that there is a message on the answering machine. The message is from Mike and tells Larry that he feels weird about something from the dinner party. Larry and Cheryl speculate what the message is about and Larry thinks it might be about Mike taking the head of table. Cheryl tells Larry it might be about how Larry does not like it when people stay at their guesthouse in Martha's Vineyard. Maggie might have overheard and might have told Mike because Maggie and Mike were planning on going to vacation there. ,323
416,older,exp1,going and anyway so then let's go back then then they do go to the Aamco and the things I just talked about earlier that's what happens at the aamco dealer the guy Mike says he'll fix it he's going to cover the labor,J1,44,31.0,J,AAMCO Station,Chevy,Larry and Jeff are at the AAMCO station. Mike tells them that there is an issue with the transmission and that he can fix it. ,44
416,older,exp1,but so Larry goes in and sits with him pisses him off because he said he you know  Mike so so yeah there was something I wanted to talk to you about and Larry said oh yeah you said I'm sorry said it was probably about our guest house on you know on Martha's Vineyard I'm sure you know maybe I maybe you guys have cuz we said we don't have guests staying in the house and the guy says oh no he says he's apologized till he said I sat in your chair I probably shouldn't have sat in your chair and Larry says you know he's like oh don't worry about that don't worry about it you know even though we know that it really did bother him that he sat in that chair  anyway and then this Mike guy gets really pissed off that he says Martha's Vineyard he said he says that wouldn't bother me that you said that you think that we don't have friends at Martha's Vineyard we have a ton of friends at Martha's Vineyard. You know what would make you think that we would need to bother you for you know staying in Martha's Vineyard anyway Larry manages to just really piss the guy off because as if he's intimating that they don't know that Mike and Margie don't have friends or people that they could have stayed with they certainly would not have needed to stay at at at Larry David's house at Martha's Vineyard and he just was offended so it essentially you know and then Mike says look you need to get out of here whatever,J4,45,34.0,J,AAMCO Station,Dinner_Party,"Mike tells Larry to take a seat in his office and thanks him about the dinner party. Mike begins to apologize to Larry but Larry cuts him off and tells him that Cheryl should have not said anything about the vineyard. Mike was apologizing for taking the head of the table.
